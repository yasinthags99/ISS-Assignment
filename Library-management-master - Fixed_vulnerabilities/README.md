# Library-management
This project is designed in basic HTML and PHP. This project describes about how to manage books for an college/school library. We have included things such that, the student needs to go to the library only for taking/returning the book. The book's availability will be displayed online to the student.
The student can now check about the availability of the books,the return date and the amount of fine to be paid in case of late return of the book.
